# CouchRest-Rails

A Rails plugin for connecting to and working with a [CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org) document-oriented database via the [CouchRest](http://github.com/jchris/couchrest) RESTful CouchDB client.

Specifically, this plugin provides the following utilities:

* Initializer for use with a couchdb.yml configuration file
* CouchDB-specific rake tasks (database creation, deletion, fixture loading, views synchronization)
* CouchDB-specific fixtures
* Setup and teardown helpers for spec'ing and testing
* A paper-thin wrapper around CouchRest::ExtendedDocument

This plugin currently assumes your application only uses one CouchDB database.  It does not interfere with the traditional relational database backend, so you can use that as a datastore alongside CouchDB if you want.  (In fact, you'll have to unwire the requirement for a relational database if you don't want to use one.)

## Requirements

* [CouchRest gem](http://github.com/jchris/couchrest)
* [RSpec](http://github.com/dchelimsky/rspec) BDD framework (optional - for running plugin specs)
* [RSpec-Rails](http://github.com/dchelimsky/rspec-rails) library (optional - for running plugin specs)


## Installation

Install with the native Rails plugin installation script:

    script/plugin install git://github.com/hpoydar/couchrest-rails.git

Or simply add to vendor/plugins and generate the files you need:

    script/generate couch_rest_rails relax
    
The plugin creates two folders:

* `db/couch/fixtures` - for storing CouchDB fixtures (yaml)
* `db/couch/views` - for storing CouchDB map and reduce functions (views)

These paths can be customized in an initializer or environment configuration file:

    CouchRestRails.fixtures_path  = 'custom/path/to/your/fixtures/from/app/root'
    CouchRestRails.views_path     = 'custom/path/to/your/views/from/app/root'
    
## Usage    

### Rake tasks

Use the rake tasks to create, delete, reset, push views and load fixtures:

    rake -T | grep couchdb
    
### Tests and specs
    
For testing or spec'ing, use these helpers to setup and teardown a test database with fixtures:

    CouchRestRails::Tests.setup
    CouchRestRails::Tests.teardown
    
There are also some simple matchers you can can use to spec validations.  See `spec/lib/matchers`.

### CouchRestRails document model

For models, inherit from CouchRestRails::Document, which hooks up CouchRest::ExtendedDocument to your CouchDB backend   and includes the [Validatable](http://validatable.rubyforge.org/) module:

    class YourCouchDocument < CouchRestRails::Document
      
      property  :email
      property  :question
      property  :answer
      property  :rating

      timestamps!

      view_by :email
      
      validates_presence_of :question
      validates_numericality_of :rating
      
      ...
      
    end

See the CouchRest documentation and specs for more information about CouchRest::ExtendedDocument. (The views defined here are in addition to the ones you can manually set up and push via rake in db/couch/views.)

### CouchDB views
    
Custom views--outside of the ones defined in your CouchRestRails::Document models--that you want to push up to the CouchDB database/server instance should be in the following format:

    db/couch/views
        |-- <design_document_name>
            |-- <view_name>
                |-- map.js
                `-- reduce.js
                
Push up your views via rake (`rake couchdb:views:push`) or within your code or console (`CouchRestRails::Views.push`).

## Further development and testing

To run the test suite, you'll need rspec installed with rspec-rails library enabled for the host application. You can run the tests in the following way:

    <rails_root>$ rake spec:plugins
    <plugin_root>$ rake spec
    <plugin_root>$ autospec
    
(The latter requires the ZenTest gem)

## TODO

* Roll up CouchRest::ExtendedDocument, since it might be deprecated from CouchRest (see CouchRest raw branch)
* A persistent connection object? Keep-alive?
* Hook into Rails logger to display times for CouchDB operations
* Mechanism for better view testing?
* Restful model/controller/test/spec generator
* Gemify
* Add more parseable options to couchdb.yml
* Expand beyond a single database per application
